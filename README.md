# FreeCodeCamp
Projects from Free Code Camp
This was my very first coding project
This is a page full of projects I have done while completeing the FREECODECAMP course.
Just some learnings:
- Need to better organise my code
- Need to learn better css
- Need to make my code a lot easier to read and follow
